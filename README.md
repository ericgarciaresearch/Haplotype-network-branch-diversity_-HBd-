# Haplotype network branch diversity (*HBd*)
[HapNetComplexity.R](https://github.com/ericgarciaresearch/Haplotype-network-branch-diversity_HBd/blob/main/HapNetComplexity.R) estimates complexity of haplotype networks (*HBd*) by combining haplotype (*Hd*) and topological (*Bd*) diversity

Use this script to build haplotype networks and calculate:

*	Nucleotide diversity (Pi) = a measurement of the genetic distance between sequences
*	Haplotype diversity (Hd) = a measurement of the genetic diversity in a population
*	Branch diversity (Bd) = a new measurement of the topological diversity in a haplotype network or the diversity of interrelationships among the observed haplotypes in a population
*	Haplotype Network Branch diversity (HBd) = a new measurement of the complexity in a haplotype network

Additional calculations:

*	Number of individuals (n)
*	Number of haplotypes (nH)
*	Number of haplotype classes (nHc)
*	Frequency of haplotype classes (niHc)
